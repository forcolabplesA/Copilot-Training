# Copilot-Training
Luau specialized Copilot
# 🔥 LuaU Copilot Godmode Trainer

This repository is a **dedicated training ground for GitHub Copilot**, designed to teach it **how to write LuaU code like a top-tier Roblox developer**.

It contains highly structured, typed, and modern LuaU examples that follow best practices used in real Roblox game systems, including:

- ✅ Strict typing with `--!strict`
- ✅ Object-Oriented Patterns (OOP via metatables)
- ✅ Typed functions, tables, enums, and modules
- ✅ Combat logic, damage systems, UI tweens
- ✅ RemoteEvents (Client ↔ Server)
- ✅ NPC AI (PathfindingService)
- ✅ Custom signal/event systems
- ✅ TweenService and Debris-based visual effects
- ✅ Mobile + desktop-friendly input logic
- ✅ Modular, scalable, maintainable code

## ⚔️ Purpose

> This repo **exists purely to make GitHub Copilot smarter** at LuaU and Roblox scripting.
>
> By keeping this code open in your editor, Copilot will:
>
> - Learn your preferred structure and typing
> - Suggest better completions and patterns
> - Avoid bad habits like globals or untyped garbage
> - Write code as if it was born inside Roblox Studio

## 🧠 Philosophy

This repo uses **strict mode (`--!strict`)** on all scripts to:
- Catch bugs early
- Improve Copilot context
- Make auto-completions more reliable
- Teach good structure and clarity

Every file is built for:
- Readability
- Reusability
- Performance
- AI-assisted development
